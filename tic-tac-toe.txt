Notes from followin the react tutorial:
test 1| all code given | renders one box with an X
test 2| add additional element | 2 boxes with X followed by two semi colons
    > solution semi colons not needed at the end of component lines only javascript lines
test 3| create numpad board | test successful (identical to tutorial)
test 4| replaced buttons with custom component (remember to capitalize)
test 5| added clicking functionality | can't view console
    > in order to view console outputs it is necessary to view the port in a browser as opposed to vscodes simple browser
test 6| clicking now changes box to X | recieved Vite error
    > solution dont pass an argument into a function if it would have the same name as a state
test 7| managing game state now | it is necessary to use () => handleclick(i) for the arguments of the components, though I am unsure why
test 8| added winner check before placing tiles | when I have created a winning state the board can not be modified, appears to work as intended
test 9| added text that idenifies the winner | everything disappeared.
    > moved winner check to inside of board component | old game is back, text functionality still does not appear
    > added a div with the status info to the board function | game now functions as intended
